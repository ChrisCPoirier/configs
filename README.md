# My PHP/Python vimrc

I put this together in one day to make a viable IDE for PHP developement with vim.

## How to install?
To install it simply do following:

    git clone https://github.com/ChrisCPoirier/configs ~/.vim_runtime
    sh ~/.vim_runtime/install_vimrc.sh

## How to update to latest version?

Simply just do a git rebase!

    cd ~/.vim_runtime
    git pull --rebase


## Some screenshots
We have none! :(

## Included Plugins

I recommend reading the docs of these plugins to understand them better. Each of them provide a much better Vim experience!

* [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen): Manages the runtime path of the plugins
* [YankRing](https://github.com/vim-scripts/YankRing.vim): Maintains a history of previous yanks, changes and deletes
* [snipMate.vim](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate): snipMate.vim aims to be a concise vim script that implements some of TextMate's snippets features in Vim
* [bufexplorer.zip](https://github.com/vim-scripts/bufexplorer.zip): Buffer Explorer / Browser. This plugin can be opened with `<leader+o>`
* [NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree): A tree explorer plugin for vim

* [ag.vim](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim): A much faster Ack
* [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim): Fuzzy file, buffer, mru and tag finder. In my config it's mapped to `<Ctrl+F>`, because `<Ctrl+P>` is used by YankRing

* [vim-indent-object](https://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object): Defines a new text object representing lines of code at the same indent level. Useful for python/vim scripts
* [vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors): Sublime Text style multiple selections for Vim, CTRL+N is remapped to CTRL+S (due to YankRing)
* [vim-expand-region](https://github.com/terryma/vim-expand-region): Allows you to visually select increasingly larger regions of text using the same key combination.
* [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline): Lean & mean status/tabline for vim that's light as air (replacing powerline)
* [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive): A Git wrapper so awesome, it should be illegal
* [goyo.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) and [vim-zenroom2](https://github.com/amix/vim-zenroom2): 
Remove all clutter and focus only on the essential. Similar to iA Writer or Write Room [Read more here](http://amix.dk/blog/post/19744)
* [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary): Comment stuff out.  Use `gcc` to comment out a line (takes a count), `gc` to comment out the target of a motion. `gcu` uncomments a set of adjacent commented lines.
* [syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic): Syntax checking hacks for vim


Do following:
* Remove `~/.vim_runtime`
* Remove any lines that refernce `.vim_runtime` in your `~/.vimrc`
